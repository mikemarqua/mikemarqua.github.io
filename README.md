This is a dedicated webserver for the CIS 114 class for College of San Mateo. All homework assignments and other code/files will be lsited underneath here. Also essentially a trial run for HTML coding, as this is the first attempt creating HTML in any format. If you have made it this far, you must be relatively interested.
